# notes-app_django-crud 

this is a notes app creating with django. i didn't use any advanced things in here . therefore it will helpful to beginners who learning the crud concept in this app i used the classbased views . because i think classbased viewses are less cody and simple to learn .

views i used: View, TemplateView, ListView, DetailView, DeleteView, UpdateView

it works just as the names suggest . i used like this. i think there are many useful things to with this:

View for rendering files with get and post stuffs TemplateView simply rendered a page, ListView listed all items DetailView helped to provide Details of a specific item/selected note UpdateView for update/edit the specified note DeleteView for deleting as the name suggest

image uploading, Forms, sqlite3 database is also used in this app .

some images of my this notes app .it will help you to get a idea of this .

also this is my first django project also first git repository

app mainpage . the write notes button will redirect the page to the add note
