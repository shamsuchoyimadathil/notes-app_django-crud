# notes-app_django-crud 

this is a notes app creating with django.i didn't use any advanced things in here . 
therefore it will helpful to beginners who learning the crud concept in this app i used the classbased views.
because i think classbased viewses are less cody and simple to learn .

views i used:<br/> View, <br/>
              TemplateView, <br/>
              ListView,<br/>
              DetailView, <br/>
              DeleteView, <br/>
              UpdateView <br/>

it works just as the names suggest . i used like this. i think there are many useful things to with this:

View for rendering files with get and post stuffs <br/> TemplateView simply rendered a page, <br/> ListView listed all items <br/> DetailView helped to provide Details of a specific item/selected note <br/> UpdateView for update/edit the specified note <br/> DeleteView for deleting as the name suggest<br/>

image uploading, Forms, sqlite3 database is also used in this app .

some images of my this notes app .it will help you to get a idea of this .

also this is my first django project also first git repository


app mainpage . the write notes button will redirect the page to the add note
