# notes-app_django-crud

this is a notes app creating with django. i didn't use any advanced things in here . therefore it will helpful to beginners who learning the crud concept 
in this app i used the classbased views . because i think classbased viewses are less cody and simple to learn .

views i used:
  View,
  TemplateView,
  ListView,
  DetailView,
  DeleteView, 
  UpdateView
  
it works just as the names suggest . 
i used like this. i think there are many useful things to with this: 

View for rendering files with get and post stuffs
TemplateView simply rendered a page,
ListView listed all items 
DetailView helped to provide Details of a specific item/selected note
UpdateView for update/edit the specified note 
DeleteView for deleting as the name suggest

image uploading, Forms, sqlite3 database is also used in this app . 

some images of my this notes app .it will help you to get a idea of this :


app mainpage . the write notes button will redirect the page to the add note
